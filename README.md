# First and Last Position of an Element In Sorted Array

You have been given a sorted array/list ARR consisting of ‘N’ elements. You are also given an integer ‘K’.
Now, your task is to find the first and last occurrence of ‘K’ in ARR.
Note :
1. If ‘K’ is not present in the array, then the first and the last occurrence will be -1. 
2. ARR may contain duplicate elements.
For example, if ARR = [0, 1, 1, 5] and K = 1, then the first and last occurrence of 1 will be 1(0 - indexed) and 2.
